# Notes

- Currently user can be part of only one organization at a time.
- Using prisma for user, and using foreign relations. I know prisma does multiple queries when I query using include.
- Have not implemented extended auth features.
- every time socket updates comes, I am refreshing the entire page. This is not optimal.
- Have not implemented pagination in timeline.
- Have not implemented scheduled maintenance yet.
